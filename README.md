# AiVarXMLTool
A tool to get an Variable XML file to Illustrator based on number ranges.

This tool would help to any illustrator user to get a variable xml file in order to make easy a linkage with data and datafields on illustrator.

This tool is based on the online tool http://joaofaraco.com.br/converter/ which takes an csv file and parses it to Aixml.
This tool can be used offline.

It's available to use it on java and python. (The source files are based on the same solution).
